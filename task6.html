        6.Scenario: Tea Stall Customer Order Processing
----------------------------------------------
Context: You are managing a small tea stall that offers different types of tea. The stall has three main types of tea:

Regular Tea: Costs ₹15 per cup.
Masala Tea: Costs ₹20 per cup.
Ginger Tea: Costs ₹25 per cup.
The stall also offers add-ons that customers can choose to enhance their tea:

Extra Sugar: Adds ₹2.50 per cup.
Extra Milk: Adds ₹5 per cup.
No Add-ons: No additional cost.

Scenario Description:
A customer approaches the stall and places an order for one type of tea with or without add-ons. You need to calculate the total price based on the customer’s choices and provide them with the final cost.

Inputs:
Tea Type: The type of tea the customer wants to order ("Regular", "Masala", or "Ginger").
Add-On: The additional option the customer selects ("Extra Sugar", "Extra Milk", or "No Add-ons").

Outputs:
Total Price: The final amount the customer needs to pay, based on their tea selection and chosen add-on.
Explanation:
Determine the Base Price:
First, identify the type of tea the customer orders. The base price is determined by this choice:
If the customer orders Regular Tea, the base price is ₹15.
If the customer orders Masala Tea, the base price is ₹20.
If the customer orders Ginger Tea, the base price is ₹25.

Calculate Add-On Costs:
Next, consider the add-on the customer chooses:
If the customer selects Extra Sugar, add ₹2.50 to the base price.
If the customer selects Extra Milk, add ₹5 to the base price.
If the customer selects No Add-ons, no additional cost is added.

Compute the Total Price:
Add the cost of the add-on (if any) to the base price of the selected tea.
Provide the Output:
The final output should be the total price that the customer needs to pay.
Example:
Example 1:

Input:

Tea Type: "Regular"
Add-On: "Extra Sugar"
Calculation:

Base Price for Regular Tea: ₹15
Add-On Cost for Extra Sugar: ₹2.50
Total Price: ₹15 + ₹2.50 = ₹17.50
Output:

Total Price: ₹17.50
Example 2:

Input:

Tea Type: "Ginger"
Add-On: "No Add-ons"
Calculation:

Base Price for Ginger Tea: ₹25
Add-On Cost for No Add-ons: ₹0.00
Total Price: ₹25 + ₹0.00 = ₹25
Output:

Total Price: ₹25
This scenario helps in understanding how to apply conditional statements to real-life situations where a decision must be made based on user input, leading to a basic output that directly reflects the choices made by the customer.
