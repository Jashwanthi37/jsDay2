        1. Scenario: Online Library Membership
---------------------------------------
Context: An online library offers different levels of membership. Depending on the type of membership, users have access to different resources:

Basic Membership: Access to only free books.

Standard Membership: Access to free books and discounted paid books.

Premium Membership: Access to all books, including exclusive content.

Question: Imagine you have a variable that stores a userâ€™s membership type. Using conditional statements, determine what resources the user can access and display a message indicating their access level. Consider how you would handle a situation where the membership type is invalid.
