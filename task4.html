        4. Scenario: Movie Ticket Pricing
----------------------------------
Context: A movie theater charges different prices based on the day of the week and the customer's age:

Weekdays: Standard price of $12. Seniors (65 and older) and children (under 12) receive a 50% discount.

Weekends: Standard price of $15. Seniors and children receive a 30% discount.

Question: Assume you have variables for the day of the week and the customerâ€™s age. Use conditional statements to determine the correct ticket price. Consider how to handle situations where the day or age is invalid.
